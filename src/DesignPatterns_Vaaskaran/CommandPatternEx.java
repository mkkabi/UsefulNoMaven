/*Here requests are encapsulated as objects. In general, four terms are associatedâ€”invoker, client, 
command, and receiver. A command object is capable of calling a particular method in the receiver. 
It stores the parameters of the methods in receiver. An invoker only knows about the command interface, 
but it is totally unware about the concrete commands. The client object holds the invoker object and the 
command object(s). The client decides which of these commands needs to execute at a particular point in time. 
To do that, he/she passes the command object to the invoker to execute that particular command.*/
