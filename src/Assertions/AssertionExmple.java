package Assertions;

//An assertion allows testing the correctness of any assumptions that have been made in the program.
//Assertion is achieved using the assert statement in Java. 
//While executing assertion, it is believed to be true. 
//If it fails, JVM throws an error named AssertionError. 
//It is mainly used for testing purposes during development.
//The assert statement is used with a Boolean expression and can be written in two different ways.

//First way : assert expression;
//Second way : assert expression1 : expression2;
// Asserions have to be enabled by providing -ea with args in command line: java â€“ea AssertionExmple
